Weaknesses of Depthwise Separable Convolutions and Inverted Residual Blocks 

1. Potential for Reduced Representational Power 

Standard convolutions can capture complex spatial relationships within the data.
DSC breaks down the convolution into depthwise (spatial) and pointwise (channel-wise) filters, which might limit the ability to learn 
intricate features, especially in earlier layers. 

2. Information Bottleneck 

The linear bottleneck (1x1 convolution or pointwise convolution) in IRBs reduces the number of channels before the depthwise separable convolution.
This compression can lead to information loss, potentially hindering the flow of complex gradients. 

3. Limited Expressive Ability in Later Stages:

EfficientNet scales down channel widths in later stages to maintain efficiency.
This can restrict the model's ability to learn highly non-linear features present in complex datasets. 

How to improve upon IRBs based upon these weaknesses 

Explore alternative separable convolution variants: There are research efforts on groups separable convolutions or channel-shuffle techniques that might offer better
representational power within separable framework.

Dynamic Channel Scaling: Instead of fixed compression in the bottleneck, consider dynamic approaches that adjust channel widths 
based on input or learned within the network. 

Introduce Attention Mechanisms: Attention mechanisms can help the network focus on informative parts of feature maps, potentially mitigating the
limitations of reduced channel widths in later stages.

--EfficientNet--
EfficientNet was developed by scaling up the base architecture using a compound method that optimizes network depth, wdith, and resolution 
The compound scaling method involves scaling the depth, width, and resolution network together, rather than independently to achieve better performance with fewer parameters. 

width scaling --- increase the number of channels 
depth scaling --- increase the number of layers 
resolution scaling --- total number of parameters input pixel resolution information scale how much resolution your image in there (layer structures)

MBConv Block used in EfficientNet is inspired by MobileNet v2's block and includes a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) module to improve its representational power.
